    <h1>Witchers, from the Kingdom of Cintra</h1>

    <p>A Witcher is someone who has trained mentally and physically for years, learned alchemy, learned monster hunting, and finally mutated through a series of inhumane experiments that make them powerful magic users and assassins.</p>
    <p>Although they kill monsters, they are veiwed as bad since they are "mutants" that have the ability to easily kill a person</p>
